# Rose
This is a gift that I created after getting inspired by Beauty and the Beast where there was a glowing rose enclosed in glass. I gave it a shot and then started adding a little functionality to it. Started by creating a basic LED setup after feeding wire up the center of the flower spine and added three more LEDs on the bottom hidden beneath three rose petals. 
I then added a motion sensor that uses a PIR to pick up any infrared heat from humans and play a sequence when someone walks in front of it (this has a slight buffer on it so it wont constantly play the sequence).
